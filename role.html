        <h2>Key Roles in the Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
            Luna moths (Actias luna) play several important roles in the ecosystem, contributing to the balance and functioning of their natural habitats.
        </p>

        <h3>Pollination</h3>
        <p>
            Although Luna moths are not as efficient as some other pollinators like bees, they do contribute to the pollination of flowers. As they visit flowers to feed on nectar, they may inadvertently transfer pollen from one flower to another, aiding in the reproductive processes of flowering plants.
        </p>

        <h3>Food Source for Predators</h3>
        <p>
            Luna moth caterpillars serve as a valuable food source for a variety of predators, including birds, spiders, and other insects. Their presence contributes to the intricate web of relationships within the ecosystem, supporting the diets of numerous organisms.
        </p>

        <h3>Nutrient Cycling</h3>
        <p>
            Luna moth caterpillars play a role in nutrient cycling. As they consume leaves from host plants, they take in nutrients. When the caterpillars molt or eventually pupate, these nutrients are returned to the environment in a form that can be utilized by other organisms.
        </p>

        <h3>Biomass Contribution</h3>
        <p>
            Luna moths, both in their caterpillar and adult stages, contribute to the overall biomass of the ecosystem. Their presence adds to the available energy and nutrients for other organisms within the food web.
        </p>

        <h3>Indicator Species</h3>
        <p>
            Luna moths can serve as indicator species, reflecting the health of their ecosystems. Changes in Luna moth populations may signal broader environmental shifts, such as alterations in habitat quality, climate conditions, or the presence of pollutants.
        </p>

        <h3>Interactions with Plants</h3>
        <p>
            Luna moth caterpillars can influence the distribution and abundance of certain plant species by selectively feeding on leaves. This can, in turn, impact the composition of vegetation in their habitat.
        </p>

        <h3>Ecotourism and Education</h3>
        <p>
            Luna moths, with their captivating appearance, can contribute to ecotourism and environmental education efforts. Their presence can attract nature enthusiasts and provide opportunities for people to learn about the importance of insect biodiversity.
