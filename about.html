        <h2>Key Features</h2>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="label">Wingspan:</div>
            <div class="description">Luna moths are relatively large insects, and their wingspan typically ranges from 3 to 4.5 inches (7.5 to 11.4 cm).</div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="label">Color:</div>
            <div class="description">The wings of a Luna moth are characterized by a beautiful pale green color. The green hue is quite vibrant and can vary in intensity. The coloration helps the moths blend in with the leaves and foliage in their habitat.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="label">Translucent Wings:</div>
            <div class="description">Luna moth wings have a somewhat translucent quality, giving them an ethereal and delicate appearance. This feature is particularly noticeable when the moths are in flight or when light passes through their wings.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="label">Eyespots:</div>
            <div class="description">Each wing of a Luna moth typically has a pair of eyespotsâ€”large, circular markings that resemble eyes. These eyespots serve a defensive function, deterring potential predators by creating the illusion of a larger, more threatening creature.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="label">Long Tails:</div>
            <div class="description">One of the distinctive features of Luna moths is the presence of long, trailing tails on their hindwings. These tails can vary in length but add to the overall elegance of their appearance.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="label">Body:</div>
            <div class="description">The body of the Luna moth is relatively small compared to its wings. The body is covered in scales, which contribute to the moth's overall coloration.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="label">Antennae:</div>
            <div class="description">Luna moths have feathery or bipectinate antennae, which are antennae with lateral branches that resemble small feathers. These antennae are used for detecting pheromones and other chemical signals.</div>
        </div>

        <p>The overall appearance of Luna moths is often described as enchanting and otherworldly. Their combination of vibrant color, translucent wings, eyespots, and long tails makes them a visually captivating species. Keep in mind that the appearance of Luna moths can vary slightly among individuals, but these general characteristics are characteristic of the species.</p>
