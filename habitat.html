        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Luna moths (Actias luna) are native to North America and can be found in a variety of habitats, primarily deciduous forests, woodlands, and gardens. They prefer areas with abundant vegetation and a diverse range of deciduous trees, which serve as the larval host plants for their caterpillars. Common host plants include walnut, hickory, sweetgum, and other hardwood trees. The availability of suitable host plants is crucial for the survival and reproduction of Luna moths.

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <h3>Nocturnal Activity</h3>
        <p>
            Luna moths are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are most active during the night. They are attracted to artificial lights, and during the summer months, you may find them near outdoor lights.
        </p>

        <h3>Feeding</h3>
        <p>
            Adult Luna moths do not have functional mouthparts, and as a result, they do not feed during their short adult lifespan. Their sole purpose during this stage is to reproduce. In contrast, Luna moth caterpillars are voracious herbivores that feed on the leaves of their host plants. Their diet consists mainly of deciduous tree leaves.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The caterpillars of Luna moths exhibit remarkable camouflage with their green coloration and small reddish spots, helping them blend into the leaves of their host plants.</li>
            <li>The adult Luna moths have eyespots on their wings, which serve a defensive function. These eyespots can deter potential predators by creating the illusion of a much larger, more threatening creature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Short Adult Lifespan</h3>
        <p>
            The adult Luna moth has a relatively short lifespan, typically ranging from one week to ten days. During this time, their primary focus is on reproduction. After mating and laying eggs, the adult Luna moth's life cycle concludes.
        </p>

        <h3>Environmental Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>
            Luna moths are sensitive to environmental changes, and their populations can be influenced by factors such as habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate conditions. Understanding the habitat preferences and behavior of Luna moths is crucial for their conservation. Efforts to preserve and protect their natural habitats contribute to the well-being of these enchanting insects.
