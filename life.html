        <h1>Luna Moth Life Cycle</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>
            The life cycle of a Luna moth (Actias luna) is a fascinating and intricate process that involves four distinct stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (cocoon or chrysalis), and adult.

    <section>
        <h2>Egg Stage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The life cycle begins when a female Luna moth lays eggs on the undersides of leaves. These eggs are typically small, round, and green.</li>
            <li>The female attaches the eggs to the leaves using a sticky substance, securing them in a location where they are less likely to be detected by predators.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Larva (Caterpillar) Stage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the eggs hatch, tiny Luna moth caterpillars emerge. The caterpillars are initially very small and may have a dark coloration.</li>
            <li>As they grow, Luna moth caterpillars develop a vibrant green color with small reddish spots along their bodies.</li>
            <li>The caterpillars feed voraciously on the leaves of various deciduous trees, including walnut, hickory, and sweetgum.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Pupa (Cocoon or Chrysalis) Stage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After reaching a sufficient size, the Luna moth caterpillar enters the pupa stage, forming a cocoon or chrysalis. This is a protective casing spun from silk.</li>
            <li>Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis, transforming into the adult moth. This process involves the restructuring of tissues, organs, and the development of wings.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Adult Stage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The adult Luna moth emerges from the cocoon as a fully developed and mature insect. This stage is characterized by the presence of large, vibrant green wings, each adorned with distinctive eyespots.</li>
            <li>It also has a relatively short lifespan, typically ranging from one week to ten days.</li>
            <li>The primary goal of the adult stage is reproduction. Luna moths are nocturnal and are most active during the night, seeking out mates to reproduce.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <p>
            The entire life cycle, from egg to adult, can take several weeks to a few months, depending on factors such as temperature and environmental conditions. Luna moths are a testament to the wonders of metamorphosis, showcasing the remarkable transformations that insects undergo to adapt to different stages of their lives.
